# Delete Job Feature Implementation

## Overview

Added the ability for users to delete their own job postings directly from the job cards in the find-jobs page (`/jobs`).

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

### What Was Done

**1. Updated Job Card Component** (`src/components/jobs/job-card.tsx`)
- Added `DeleteJobButton` component with confirmation dialog
- Integrated delete functionality with Firebase Firestore
- Shows delete button only for jobs posted by the current user
- Added trash icon button positioned next to the bookmark button
- Includes confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletions

**2. Key Features**
- **User Verification**: Delete button only appears for jobs where `job.posterId === user.uid`
- **External Job Protection**: Delete button doesn't show for LinkedIn/Naukri jobs
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Users must confirm before deletion
- **Loading State**: Shows "Deleting..." during the deletion process
- **Toast Notifications**: Success/error feedback after deletion
- **Auto-Refresh**: Job list automatically updates after deletion (Firebase real-time listeners)

## üéØ Features

### Delete Button Visibility
- ‚úÖ Only visible to the user who posted the job
- ‚úÖ Not shown for external jobs (LinkedIn, Naukri)
- ‚úÖ Positioned in the top-right corner (left of bookmark button)
- ‚úÖ Red trash icon for clear visual indication

### Confirmation Dialog
- **Title**: "Delete Job Posting?"
- **Description**: Clear warning about permanent deletion
- **Actions**: Cancel or Delete buttons
- **Disabled State**: Buttons disabled during deletion
- **Destructive Styling**: Delete button styled in red

### User Experience
1. User sees trash icon on their own job postings
2. Clicks trash icon ‚Üí Confirmation dialog appears
3. Confirms deletion ‚Üí Job is deleted from Firebase
4. Success toast notification appears
5. Job card automatically disappears from the list

## üìÇ Files Modified

### `src/components/jobs/job-card.tsx`

**Added:**
- `DeleteJobButton` component with AlertDialog
- Delete functionality using Firebase `deleteDoc`
- User ownership check (`isOwnJob`)
- Confirmation dialog with loading states

**Key Code:**
```typescript
function DeleteJobButton({ jobId, onDeleted }: { jobId: string; onDeleted?: () => void }) {
    const { user } = useUser();
    const firestore = useFirestore();
    const [showDeleteDialog, setShowDeleteDialog] = useState(false);
    const [isDeleting, setIsDeleting] = useState(false);

    const handleDelete = async () => {
        setIsDeleting(true);
        try {
            const jobRef = doc(firestore, 'job_postings', jobId);
            await deleteDoc(jobRef);
            toast({
                title: 'Job Deleted',
                description: 'The job posting has been successfully removed.',
            });
            setShowDeleteDialog(false);
            if (onDeleted) {
                onDeleted();
            }
        } catch (error) {
            toast({
                variant: 'destructive',
                title: 'Error',
                description: 'Failed to delete the job posting.',
            });
        } finally {
            setIsDeleting(false);
        }
    };
    // ... AlertDialog UI
}

export function JobCard({ job, onDeleted }: { job: JobPosting; onDeleted?: () => void }) {
  const { user } = useUser();
  const isExternalJob = job.source && job.source !== 'internal';
  const isOwnJob = user && job.posterId === user.uid;
  
  return (
    <Card className="flex flex-col relative">
       <SaveJobButton jobId={job.id} />
       {isOwnJob && !isExternalJob && <DeleteJobButton jobId={job.id} onDeleted={onDeleted} />}
       {/* ... rest of card */}
    </Card>
  );
}
```

## üîß How It Works

### Ownership Check
```typescript
const isOwnJob = user && job.posterId === user.uid;
```
- Compares current user's ID with the job's `posterId`
- Only shows delete button if they match

### Delete Flow
1. **User clicks trash icon** ‚Üí Opens confirmation dialog
2. **User confirms** ‚Üí Calls `handleDelete()`
3. **Firebase deletion** ‚Üí `deleteDoc(jobRef)` removes from Firestore
4. **Real-time update** ‚Üí Firebase listener auto-updates the UI
5. **Toast notification** ‚Üí User receives feedback

### Firebase Integration
- Uses `deleteDoc` from `firebase/firestore`
- Deletes from `job_postings` collection
- Automatic UI refresh via `useCollection` hook in parent component

## üé® UI Components Used

- **AlertDialog**: Confirmation dialog from Radix UI
- **Button**: Ghost variant for icon button
- **Trash2 Icon**: From Lucide React
- **Toast**: For success/error notifications

## üöÄ Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **As Job Owner**
   - Visit `/jobs` page
   - Find a job you posted
   - Verify trash icon appears in top-right corner
   - Click trash icon ‚Üí Confirmation dialog appears
   - Click "Delete" ‚Üí Job is removed
   - Verify success toast appears

2. **As Non-Owner**
   - Visit `/jobs` page
   - View jobs posted by others
   - Verify NO trash icon appears

3. **External Jobs**
   - View LinkedIn/Naukri jobs
   - Verify NO trash icon appears (even if you're logged in)

4. **Not Logged In**
   - Visit `/jobs` page without login
   - Verify NO trash icons appear on any jobs

### Manual Testing Steps

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:9002/jobs
# 1. Login with your account
# 2. Post a test job
# 3. Find your job in the list
# 4. Click the trash icon
# 5. Confirm deletion
# 6. Verify job disappears
```

## üîí Security

### Client-Side Checks
- Delete button only shows for job owner
- Prevents accidental UI access

### Server-Side Security
- **‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED**: Firebase Security Rules enforce ownership
- Current rule in `firestore.rules`:
```javascript
match /job_postings/{jobPostingId} {
  function isPoster() {
    return request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.posterId;
  }
  allow update, delete: if isPoster();
}
```
- This ensures only the job poster can delete their own jobs at the database level

## üí° Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add "Undo" functionality (soft delete)
- [ ] Archive jobs instead of permanent deletion
- [ ] Bulk delete multiple jobs
- [ ] Delete confirmation with job title display
- [ ] Admin override to delete any job
- [ ] Delete job statistics/analytics
- [ ] Email notification on job deletion

## üìù Notes

- Delete is **permanent** - no undo functionality
- Firebase real-time listeners automatically update the UI
- Works on all pages that use `JobCard` component
- Consistent with existing delete functionality in job details page
- Uses same AlertDialog pattern as other destructive actions
